\section{Summary}\label{sec:summary}

In this paper we showed that the partial sums technique of Ferguson \etal~\cite{FSE:FKLSSWW00} and the FFT-based technique of Todo and Aoki~\cite{CANS:TodAok14} can be combined into a new technique that allows enjoying `the best of the two worlds'. The combination improves over the best previously known attacks on 6-round AES by a factor of more than 32, as we verified experimentally. 

Furthermore, the new technique allows improving other attacks --- most notably, we improve the best known attack against Kuznyechik~\cite{Kuznyechik} by a factor of more than 80. Our method also yields the best known attack against the full MISTY1~\cite{MISTY1} by a factor of~6, and improve the partial sums attacks against reduced-round CLEFIA~\cite{CLEFIA} by varying factors (including a huge factor of $2^{30}$, on 12-round CLEFIA-128) as shown in the full version of this paper~\cite{fullversion}. We expect that our new technique will be used to improve other cryptanalytic attacks, and will (again) highlight the strength and potential of FFT-based techniques in improving cryptanalytic attacks.
